    <p class='dscrptn'> URL shortener microservice prototype based on Django Framework.</p>
    <p class='dscrptn'> Django is a free, open source, high-end framework written in Python. 
        It's also fast, flexible and got unit test framework. 
        So Django contains all the elements necessary for the realisation of such microservice from the box. </p>
    <p class='dscrptn'>  </p>
    <p class='dscrptn'> Pnpl Shrtnr may be used by itself as standalone application or be a part of other one. It consists from database with URLs and shortcodes for them, 
        few functions (check isn't submitted URL already in db; generate shortcode for given URL; add new URL into db and assign genereted shortcode to it; 
        redirect to original URL from shortcode etc), few HTML pages to wrap it all in and this 'About' page.</p>
    <p class='dscrptn'> Right now Pnpl Shrtnr fully copes with his main task. But it can be easily improved by adding new features. 
        Such as: URL usage stats, make not used for a long time URLs inactive or delete them, create some Django commands for service managment and maintaining,
        do something in situation when shorcode is incorrect or does not exists, make another shortcode generator with words instead of letters and digits (pnpl.com/LazyNackedGekko)
        to make redirected links easy to remember or even probably give user a tool to make their own shortcodes.</p>
